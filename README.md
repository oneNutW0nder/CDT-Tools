For installtion on the target machine simply run _deployment.sh_ as root

Once _deployment.sh_ has been run successfully you no longer have normal
binaries for 
* ls
* ps
* who
* cat 
* vim

The original binaries have been moved to _/lib/module_BINARYNAME and can 
still be used normally if you provide the full path.
